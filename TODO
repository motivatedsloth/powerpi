Classes:

PZEM: # represents a sensor
	master = ttyUSB0
	sensor = 'solar'|'main' 
	power = 123 # float current power reading from sensor
	voltage = 122 
	
	onread(callback) ## callback is passed current PZEM instance
	read()


Circuit:
	solar = 123 # current watts positive when generating, negative when pulling
	main = 122 # current watts, positive whel pulling from grid, negative when pushing to grid

	## need to determine a reasonable size for these stacks
	solarstack: # array of power readings
	mainstack: # array of power readings
	
	algorithm to determine correct sign on main:
		if solar is < main +
		if solar is tracking main -
		if solar is tracking inverse +
		if approaches zero and continues at similar velocity toggle
